In Android, an **Intent** is like a messenger or a request that allows one part of your app to communicate with another part of your app, or even with other apps. 
It is used to **perform actions** such as opening a new screen (activity), sending data, or starting a service.

There are two main types of intents:

1. **Explicit Intent**: - Example: Opening a specific screen in your app.
   
2. **Implicit Intent**: - Example: Opening a webpage in a browser or sending an email.
